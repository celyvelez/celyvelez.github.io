# Project 03
## Do you want to read a Colombian book at the Harvard Library?

This is my submission for Project 03 of Lede 2023. 

When I was in college, both in my undergrad and in my master's, the majority of books or texts we used to study were in English. And not Colombian books in English, but books published elsewhere. When I came across Harvad's Library API, I wanted to see if they also used Colombian books in Spanish.

### Findings
Harvard's Library has more than 27 million books. Out of those, almost 800 thousand are in Spanish. And those printed in Colombia? Just 109. That's about 0.1% of the books in Spanish and 0.0004% of the entire library.

Colombian literature books are the most prominent topic, followed by history and journalism texts.

The 1820s decade is not only the decade with the most books published (tied with the 1980s) but also the decade where the greatest concentration of history texts are. The other decade with the most published books is the 1980s, with the most literature books.

Out of the 54 unique authors, 31 are Colombian. Other nationalities are Venezuelan, Spanish and French.

You can only find 39 of these books in the University of the Andes' library in Bogotá.

### Data collection
I used [Harvard's Library Cloud API](https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/display/LibraryStaffDoc/LibraryCloud+APIs) to collect the data. The information on the topics, author's nationality and whether the books can be found in the University of the Andes in Bogotá were retrieved manually and added in Google Sheets.

### Data analysis
The analysis of topics, decades and publishing companies was done with pandas and Google Sheets.

### Charts
The charts were done with Illustrator. 

### Skills learned 
From the beginning I wanted this project to be more about the story and captivating the audience, so I mostly worked on that.

### Further questions
If I were to continue with this project, I would like to find the answer to the following questions:
- How did these books get to the Harvard Library?
- Can some of these books be found at any library in Colombia?
