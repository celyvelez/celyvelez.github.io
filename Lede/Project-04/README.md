# Project 04
## Colombian compensatory conservation fees don't even cover the Minister's coffee expenses*
*probably

This is my submission for Project 04 of Lede 2023. 

At the national level, native wildlife can be hunted for various purposes: subsistence, commercial, promotion, control, sport and scientific. These uses require authorization by the environmental authority, except for subsistence hunting.

The use of this natural resource is subject to the payment of a fee, called the compensatory fee for wildlife hunting, recently regulated.

But, do Colombian conservation fees really have a meaningful impact in biodiversity?

### Findings
The dataset includes requests from 2016 to 2021 (and one entry for 2022). In total, there were 1526 requests during these years, and 96% were for scientific purposes. The rest were for commercial (65) and promotion (1) purposes.

The top collected species are the ground beetle, the Atlantic canary, different species from the Psocodea family, the Seba's short-tailed bat and the yellow-striped poison frog. All of them are classified with a "least concern" conservation status.

For the six years 2016-2021 (and one entry in 2022) the fees raised 36.4 million Colombian pesos. That is roughly nine thousand US dollars.

If we devide by the six year period, every year 1.5 thousand USD (six million COP) were raised, which turns out to be 125 USD (500 thousand COP) per month.

### Data collection
I used the Colombian open source dataset [Datos de la Tasa compensatoria por Caza de Fauna Silvestre](https://www.datos.gov.co/Ambiente-y-Desarrollo-Sostenible/Datos-de-la-Tasa-compensatoria-por-Caza-de-Fauna-S/e8q4-8mx9) to collect the data. 

### Data analysis
The analysis was done using pandas and Google Sheets.

### Charts
The charts were done with Illustrator. 

### Skills learned 
From the beginning I wanted this project to be more about the story and captivating the audience, so I mostly worked on that.

### Further questions
If I were to continue with this project, I would like to find the answer to the following questions:
- Why are the maths formulas not applied correctly to calculate the final values?
- Who are the people that aske for species for commercial use?
